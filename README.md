# Pharmacy Sales & Profitability Analysis

**BDM Capstone Project – IIT Madras BS in Data Science and Applications**

This repository contains the analysis and findings from a **Business Data Management (BDM) Capstone Project** focused on optimizing profitability and inventory efficiency at **Rudra Medical & General Stores**, a retail pharmacy in Nagarkurnool, Telangana.  
The project evaluates sales, purchases, margins, and inventory efficiency for **82 products across 17 medical categories**, with a special focus on pediatric care.

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Objective:** Boost sales and profit margins by analyzing sales data, purchase records, and inventory performance.  
- **Data Used:**  
  - **Sales Data:** 10,292 transactions  
  - **Purchase Data:** 410 records  
- **Period of Analysis:** June – August 2024  
- **Tools:** Microsoft Excel, OpenRefine

## 🧩 Analysis Methods
The following analytical techniques were applied:

1. **Profit Margin Analysis** – Unit-level and total profit per SKU using weighted averages.  
2. **Batch-wise Cost Efficiency** – Comparison of purchase rates across batches to identify the cheapest suppliers.  
3. **ABC Profit-Based Segmentation** – Ranking SKUs by profit contribution into A (high), B (medium), C (low).  
4. **Category-wise Sales Contribution** – Evaluating sales by drug category (e.g., injections, tablets, syrups).  
5. **Inventory Turnover Rate (ITR)** – Measuring stock efficiency and sales velocity.  
6. **Gross Margin Return on Investment (GMROI)** – Assessing profitability per rupee invested in inventory.

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Revenue Contribution:** Injections and tablets dominated pharmacy revenue, especially for pediatric use.  
- **High-Margin SKUs:** Products like **I.V. Sets** and **BIO-VAC A** delivered margins >90%.  
- **Cost Efficiency:** Batch-level variations revealed procurement opportunities for savings.  
- **ABC Segmentation:**  
  - **Category A (7% SKUs)** → 67% of total profit  
  - **Category B (20% SKUs)** → 22% of profit  
  - **Category C (73% SKUs)** → 11% of profit  
- **Inventory Turnover:** Majority of SKUs were well-placed (profitable + good turnover), but some essential items had poor margins.  
- **GMROI Leaders:** **BIO-POLIO**, **CIDAL INJ**, and **HEXAXIM** showed exceptional return on investment (>100).

## ✅ Recommendations
- **Profit Margins:** Revisit pricing/vendor negotiations for low-margin but high-volume SKUs.  
- **Batch Efficiency:** Track per-unit batch prices and bulk order from cost-efficient suppliers.  
- **ABC Segmentation:** Maintain minimum 2-week stock for Category A SKUs and allocate more shelf space.  
- **Category Management:** Keep pediatric injections and syrups well-stocked during peak demand.  
- **Inventory Turnover:** Bundle slow-movers with fast-movers to avoid stagnation.  
- **GMROI Tracking:** Set a threshold (e.g., GMROI > 2) to guide stocking decisions.

## 🏆 Conclusion
This project demonstrated how **data-driven decision-making** can transform pharmacy operations.  
By combining **margin analysis, ABC classification, ITR, and GMROI**, the study highlighted which SKUs are critical to both **profitability and patient care**.  
Strategic recommendations such as **bundling low-margin items, vendor negotiation, and prioritizing high-GMROI SKUs** can significantly improve both financial stability and healthcare service delivery.
